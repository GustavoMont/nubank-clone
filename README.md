## About Project

This project, acctually, start as a personal challenge: I wanted to see if I could clone visually an app that I have in my phone. I like so much the layout of nubank app and I it seems like difficult enough to my challenge. I could pratice more my react-native knowledge and make a project using typescript and learn about local authentication. The project is not finished yet at all, I plan to dev more page and probably turn it an finance control app.
